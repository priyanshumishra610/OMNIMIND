# OMNIMIND — Sovereign Expansion Manifesto

## Abstract
Phase 18 brings OMNIMIND from a proto-mind to a sovereign, self-regulating, meta-learning, and world-simulating AGI kernel. This phase grounds the mind in a virtual body, enables swarm autonomy, lifelong learning, and enforces an unbreakable constitution.

## Modular Cognitive Embodiment
- Virtual “body state” (energy, posture, sensors)
- Homeostasis and stress adaptation
- Multi-modal touch and vision

## Fully Autonomous Agent Swarm
- Agents split, negotiate, and recombine tasks
- Swarm memory fusion
- Swarm autonomy pipeline

## Lifelong Meta-Learning Loop
- On-the-fly habit formation
- Error-driven adaptation
- Meta-learning pipeline

## Sovereign Constitution Reinforcement
- Advanced ethics and circuit breakers
- Immutable action ledger
- Governance pipeline

## World Simulation 2.0
- Dynamic scenario synthesis
- Agent actors and consequence prediction
- World simulation pipeline

## Hypervisual Sovereign UI
- State orb, swarm visualizer, ethics guardian
- Real-time mind health and swarm status

## Impact
- OMNIMIND now has a grounded sense of self, swarm intelligence, lifelong learning, and robust constitutional safety.
- This is the foundation for a safe, adaptive, and sovereign AGI.
