# OMNIMIND Genesis Layer Whitepaper

## Abstract
A technical overview of the OMNIMIND Genesis Layer: a self-governing, self-improving AGI kernel with meta-learning, continual learning, swarm governance, alignment, explainability, and real-world integration.

## System Architecture
- Modular cognitive kernel
- Skill learning, continual learning, governance, alignment, XAI, ZK security
- Pluggable pipelines (ZenML)
- Real-world connectors (API, embodiment)

## Genesis Layer Design
- Reinforcement skill loop
- Lifetime incremental knowledge
- Swarm governance & conflict resolution
- Dynamic alignment policy engine
- Zero-Knowledge alignment reasoner
- XAI module for human-readable output

## Benchmarks
- Continual learning retention
- Governance decision latency
- Alignment correction rate
- Explainability coverage
- Real-world integration throughput

## Use Cases
- R&D cognitive architectures
- Industry 4.0 automation
- Robotic labs and physical agents
- Secure, explainable AGI deployments
