### ⚡ **What is OMNIMIND?**

OMNIMIND is not a chatbot.
It’s not just another RAG pipeline.
It’s not “yet another AI toy.”

**OMNIMIND is your personal AGI seed** — a *self-curating*, *self-reasoning*, *self-simulating* cognitive engine that:

* 📚 **Retrieves** trusted knowledge from vast sources
* 🤖 **Verifies** information with a multi-agent swarm debate
* 🔮 **Simulates** reality when facts are missing
* 🕸️ **Maintains** a living Knowledge Graph, Vector DB & Thought Snapshots
* 🔄 **Self-repairs** failing pipelines using genetic algorithms
* 🔗 **Anchors** answers with cryptographic proof trails
* 🧠 **Thinks about its own thinking**, stores it for you to inspect
* 🌐 **Federates** across devices, forming a *personal knowledge mesh*

**One mind. Infinite reach. Fully yours.**

### 🔑 **Core Loop**

1️⃣ **Ingest** → Crawl trusted sources

2️⃣ **Chunk & Embed** → Adaptive chunker + multi-embedding models

3️⃣ **Hybrid Search** → Vector DB + KG for ultra-relevant recall

4️⃣ **Council of Minds** → Agent debate, counter-check, consensus

5️⃣ **Simulate** → If incomplete, run local world-models

6️⃣ **Immutable Proof** → Hash answers, store source & cost

7️⃣ **Reflect** → Store chain-of-thought, detect failure

8️⃣ **Mutate** → GA rewrites broken steps

9️⃣ **Retrain & Version** → Update vectors, rerankers, swarm strategies

🔟 **Federate** → Sync mind-state across trusted devices
